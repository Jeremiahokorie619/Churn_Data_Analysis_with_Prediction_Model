# Churn_Data_Analysis_with_Prediction_Model
This project aims to demonstrate the seamless use of SQL, Python and Power BI for analyzing customer churn data, training and testing a prediction model and finally reporting findings in a visually appealing way to management

### INTRODUCTION
Churn is the term used to describe when a customer of a company chooses to either discontinue their service or patronize a competing company instead for the same service. There are several reasons why a customer may decide to "churn" and some of these reasons include(but not limited to):

a. Pricing of the Product or service being too high

b. Competing companies having a better product or offer

c. Attitude of the customer care team

d. Poor Quality of Service/Product

e. Other Personal reasons

The Company in this Project is an online entertainment provider looking to figure out why their customers choose competing businesses instead of theirs

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL19)
2. Python(Pandas) - python3
3. Microsoft Power BI Desktop

### WORK FLOW
The workflow will be summarized into 10 simple steps:
#### STEP 1: LOAD DATA INTO MSSQL
#### STEP 2: CARRY OUT BASIC EDA
#### STEP 3: LOAD DATA INTO POWER BI
#### STEP 4: TRANSFORM DATA AND BUILD DASHBOARD
#### STEP 5: LOAD DATA INTO PYTHON AND PERFORM DATA PREPARATION
#### STEP 6: SPLIT DATA AND TRAIN MODEL FOR CHURN PREDICTION
#### STEP 7: EVALUATE MODEL 
#### STEP 8: TEST MODEL ON NEW DATASET
#### STEP 9: ADD REPORTS FROM MODEL TESTING TO THE EXISTING DASHBOARD IN POWER BI
#### STEP 10: DOCUMENT AND DELIVER INSIGHTS TO MANAGEMENT

## NOTE!! see the FINAL INSIGHTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS document!!
